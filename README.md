## Features

-   **Deep Port Scanner:** A high-speed, multi-threaded port scanner with a full GUI. It scans over 1,800 common ports and performs **banner grabbing** to identify running services and versions. Includes a real-time progress bar and ETR display.

-   **Intense Subdomain Finder:** An asynchronous (`asyncio`) subdomain scanner for dramatically fast enumeration. Features **wildcard detection** to prevent false positives and performs **HTTP/S probing** on found subdomains to identify live web servers and their page titles.

-   **Web Vulnerability Scanner:** A GUI tool that scans web applications for common vulnerabilities, including **Reflected XSS**, basic **SQL Injection**, and missing **Security Headers**.
